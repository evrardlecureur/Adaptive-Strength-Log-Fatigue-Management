# Adaptive-Strength-Log-Fatigue-Management
# 🏋️‍♂️ Powerlifting Intelligent Log & Dynamic Fatigue System

## 🌟 Introduction
As a Powerlifting enthusiast, I started my journey by creating a personalized tool to track my progress. I chose **Google Spreadsheets** for its simplicity and accessibility, allowing any athlete to log data directly on their phone during a workout.

This is more than just a log; it’s an **intelligent dashboard** designed to guide athletes and coaches in programming training cycles with precision.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📈 Smart Performance Tracking
While it tracks standard metrics (Load, Reps, RPE, Sets), it goes further by integrating:
* **Precision e1RM:** Uses a refined RPE chart to estimate your 1-Rep Max with high accuracy based on your daily performance.
* **Bodyweight Integration (Pull-ups):** A dedicated system for weighted calisthenics. It calculates your total intensity by combining your **Body Weight (BW)** and **Added Load**, ensuring your bodyweight exercises are tracked as strictly as your SBD (Squat, Bench, Deadlift).

### ⚡ The "Fatigue Index" Revolution
The core innovation of this tool is the **Normalized Fatigue Index (0 to 1)**:
* **0:** No training/Complete recovery.
* **1:** Maximum recoverable volume and intensity.

This index visualizes exactly how much "tax" a week of training puts on your body. It allows for a data-driven approach to scheduling deloads and peaking phases.

### 🧬 Adaptive Engine (HTR vs. ETR)
Every athlete is different. This tool adapts to **YOU**:
* **Experience Level Scaling:** The math engine changes based on whether you are a Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced lifter (see screenshots).
* **Exercise Recovery Profiles:** Uses **HTR (Hard to Recover)** and **ETR (Easy to Recover)** labels. Heavy compound movements and isolation exercises are not treated equally, providing a truly personalized recovery score.
