# Adaptive-Strength-Log-Fatigue-Management
# 🏋️‍♂️ Powerlifting Intelligent Log & Dynamic Fatigue System

## 🌟 Introduction
As a Powerlifting enthusiast, I started my journey by creating a personalized tool to track my progress. I chose **Google Spreadsheets** for its simplicity and accessibility, allowing any athlete to log data directly on their phone during a workout.

This is more than just a log; it’s an **intelligent dashboard** designed to guide athletes and coaches in programming training cycles with precision.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📈 Smart Performance Tracking
While it tracks standard metrics (Load, Reps, RPE, Sets), it goes further by integrating:
* **Precision e1RM:** Uses a refined RPE chart to estimate your 1-Rep Max with high accuracy based on your daily performance.
* **Bodyweight Integration (Pull-ups):** A dedicated system for weighted calisthenics. It calculates your total intensity by combining your **Body Weight (BW)** and **Added Load**, ensuring your bodyweight exercises are tracked as strictly as your SBD (Squat, Bench, Deadlift).

### ⚡ The "Fatigue Index" Revolution
The core innovation of this tool is the **Normalized Fatigue Index (0 to 1)**:
* **0:** No training/Complete recovery.
* **1:** Maximum recoverable volume and intensity.

This index visualizes exactly how much "tax" a week of training puts on your body. It allows for a data-driven approach to scheduling deloads and peaking phases.

### 🧬 Adaptive Engine (HTR vs. ETR)
Every athlete is different. This tool adapts to **YOU**:
* **Experience Level Scaling:** The math engine changes based on whether you are a Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced lifter (see screenshots).
* **Exercise Recovery Profiles:** Uses **HTR (Hard to Recover)** and **ETR (Easy to Recover)** labels. Heavy compound movements and isolation exercises are not treated equally, providing a truly personalized recovery score.

### 📊 Programmation vs. Reality
The Fatigue Index chart is a powerful visualization tool to compare your training plan with your actual performance.
* **Blue Bars (Programmed):** The theoretical fatigue based on your planned sets and reps.
* **Red Bars (Actual):** The real fatigue generated based on your completed sets and your reported RPE.

> **Note:** The Red Bar (Actual Fatigue) becomes accurate only once the entire training week has been fully logged. This allows you to see if you pushed harder than planned or if you need to adjust the following week.
